Development:

When planning for this project I made an ERD, wireframes, and user stories to start off. In the beginning I was indecisive on what I wanted this project to be, ultimately I decided to create a product schema with name, text, and owner as keys then gave each crud action their curl script and tested each one. I created a file for my back end element of this project and started with product routes. When running into problems I referred back to the documentations and lessons to solve the prroblems. Then I opened up an issue to reach out to instructors and classmates for some extra help.

Unsolved problems:
When testing creating products I did not have an owner component for two products, now I am trying to figure out how to remove those products. I also want to add a review schema.

Back-end link:

The back-end of this repo allows the front end to communicate when a user is trying to sign up, sign in, change password, and sign out. It also allows the user to create, show, update, and delete their product.
